# Tech Blog

## Description

Welcome to Tech Blog! This is a blog platform where you can sign up, login, and create blogposts. As I am on a time crunch to finish the modules, I did not have time to finish the comment functionality, though there is code that is nearly there to finish this functionality. Simply sign up, go to dashboard, and view/create posts using the form on the page.
